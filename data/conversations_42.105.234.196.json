It's that feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often about something that is going to happen or might happen in the future. While some anxiety is normal, it can become a problem when it's excessive, persistent, and interferes with your daily life. This could manifest in different ways for different people \u2013 maybe as constant worrying, physical symptoms like a racing heart, or avoiding situations that trigger fear. If you're finding that anxiety is significantly impacting your well-being, it's a good idea to explore it further. Would you like to talk more about how anxiety is affecting you specifically?
